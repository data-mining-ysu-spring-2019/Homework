  Problem 1 (2 pt.)

 Suppose the sysadmin wants to understand and predict the process of recognizing the emails as spam for new e-mails which make up 20% of your initial data. Compare the performance of k-NN (at least two models) with different k values for classification on your data. Which one is better? Why?
  (Use cross-validation for choosing the best value of k. Show the result graphically).

  Problem 2 (3 pt.)

 * a. Suppose the sysadmin wants to predict the total length of words in capitals (based on their content and type) for new e-mails which make up 20% of your initial data. Compare the result of the linear regression and k-NN regression by solving the task. Which one is better? (Use RMSE, R squared to solve the task.)

 * b.  When will regression outperform the k-NN?
